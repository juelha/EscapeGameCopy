README EscapeGame Group 10



The basic idea
Since the point of this course was to take Unity to the next level navigate through a 3D world now, we wanted to take full advantage of this movement and planned to do an Escape Game. Our player would be trapped in a haunted house and would have to move around, find objects and interact with the world to get out.

Our story
We thought it would be fun to have a player who is not a real monster hunter, but a guy who lied in a bar to get free beer. Unfortunately, the villagers really believed him – so much that they locked him into this actually haunted house.

Riddles
We brainstormed a few easy riddles that the player would have to solve. For example: open a box with a 3 digit code, and every time you guess 3 numbers, the box would tell you how many numbers are wrong, how many numbers are right, but in the wrong position, and how many numbers are right and in the right position. And then the player has to use logic to crack the code.

The enemy
The enemy is one of the things we spent the most time on. We made the model of the ghost ourselves using blender, including two animations (one hovering cycle for normal movement and one disappear-into-the-ceiling-move for when he was defeated). And we even wrote our own AI, to make the chase of the player more interesting.

Animations
We tried our hand at animations in Unity as well, we wanted the doors and chests to be able to be opened. We also used animations to make the popups that were supposed to help the player understand the story and to give tips.

Teleport
Our scene was supposed to have a basement room. Instead of climbing the ladder, we decided we would let the player teleport up once he gets close enough

Problems
Unfortunately we did not have enough time in the end to really put all of our ideas together :’)
We have a fully functional scene that the player can move through and some of the animations work, but the scene makes it hard to appreciate the enemy AI and since the riddles and popups are not all done, there is not the sort of gameplay that we had envisioned. Too bad, but we’re still proud of the things that we did manage to learn and get done so far. Maybe we’ll properly finish the game in the future.
